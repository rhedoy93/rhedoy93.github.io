     <div><p>Ruby Realm is a 500-year-old supernatural town located in the middle of Quebec. It has a history of vampires, witches, werewolves and beings you wouldn’t believe that existed. It is a very small town of a population of only 5000. Its architecture and technology is vintage, but is modernizing at its own rate. Thousands of thrill seekers come yearly to see this town’s attraction and hear their share of supernatural stories at any local restaurants. Plan your trip now; you have no idea what could be awaiting <b>your</b> arrival. </p></div>
